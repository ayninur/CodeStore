Codestore+ is a MERN stack application that allows users to store snippets of notes in an easy-to-use environment. The user is able to sign up, log in to their account, create, update, and delete code snippets that can be accessed from anywhere. Below I will attach a few screenshots of a couple of pages on my web application.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:5000`
