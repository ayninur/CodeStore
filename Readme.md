Codestore+ is a MERN stack application that allows users to store snippets of notes in an easy-to-use environment. The user is able to sign up, log in to their account, create, update, and delete code snippets that can be accessed from anywhere. As a programmer who often searches for the same information over and over again, I wanted to create a simple environment where I could store information I reference frequently.
